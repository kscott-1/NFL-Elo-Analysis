Within this project, the goal is to use Julia to enhance skills with the language and to use its advantages to the fullest. The Pluto Notebook offers an extreme amount of functionality using the Julia language. For one, the notebook is completely dynamic - meaning that any change made to a variable or piece of data will automatically update any code impacted by that change. This opens up many doors to use html sliders and selections to filter data and look at graphics the exact way that the user wants to. In addition, Julia is compiled with 'Just-in-Time' or JIT. Due to this, Julia is extremely fast at updating variables throughout a dynamic Pluto notebook, allowing for a great deal of user functionality.

To the naked eye with little football knowledge, it is easy to make a few simple insights:
- Teams with low importance ratings (Ex: HOU) are probably bad and the opposite is also probably true
- The variability from week to week importance for each team is pretty high (Why?)

To answer this question, we need to know a little bit about NFL structure and what exactly this variable is explaining to us. For one, importance is a measure of how impactful a specific game is on the race for the playoffs. When two teams are both 5-5 and need a win to get back into the playoff hunt, that game will be extremely important. If one team is 0-10 and the other team is 10-0, that game is unlikely to have any impact, especially considering how heavily favored the 10-0 team will be. Next, the NFL currently has 7 playoff spots in each of the two conferences. 4 of those playoff spots are given to the team that wins their Division. Each Division is comprised of 4 teams, meaning there are 4 Divisions per Conference and 8 in total. What this tells us is that more often than not, games played between Divisional opponents will be the most important games! Furthermore, games played cross-conference will be of much lower importance (Teams are not competing for the same playoff spots). Is this true in the graphic?

FiveThirtyEight provides an Elo Rating for every team in the NFL. This rating is updated weekly based upon results and is transferred over from year to year with a small shift to the mean. The idea in this graphic is that teams with a higher Elo Rating should generally be considered to be the better team. Out of all games completed in 2022 thusfar, the graph will plot the score difference and elo difference between the two teams. When the score difference is positive, the favorite won and when it is negative, the underdog won. Naturally there are many other factors which go into games, but is Elo alone a good predictor?

Now that we have our plot, is there any obvious break to be found here? It appears so.

Thusfar in 2022, it seems that if the Elo difference is greater than 50, the rate at which the Higher Elo team actually wins increases. At lower Elo difference levels, the prediction given by Elo is significantly less accurate. In fact, with a difference of 50 Elo or less, the Lower Elo team wins the game more often than not.

This isn't incredibly surprising - This confirms the logical notion that more lopsided matchups are less likely to produce an unexpected outcome.

Let's discuss. Does this model tell us anything at all? Is this model useful for predictions?

Beginning with simple insights, this model does tell us something. Judging by the results table produced by our model, the x term (Elo Difference) has a significance level of 0.0339. Using an alpha level of 0.05, this term is significant - meaning there _is_ a relationship between the predictor and the outcome. In the context of our model, this means that there is a presence of a positive relationship between Elo Difference and Score Difference (i.e. as Elo Difference increases, Score Difference increases as well).

Despite these insights, this model will not be useful for any sort of score prediction. Looking at the graphic, we can immediately see the extreme variability in this scatterplot. While there is presence of a trend, there are simply too many factors that go into which team wins an NFL game to find use out of a linear, one predictor model. This is further backed up by the low R^2 value of roughly .02 - this tells us mathematically that our data is too variable for the model.

In the end, Elo seems to be a good indicator of overall team strength. The good teams have high Elo and the bad teams have low Elo (as is the intention). Despite these, the predictions provided by Elo ratings are hard to trust as a prediction tool. The predictions may give a slight edge over guessing, but there is too much variability for a confident and precise prediction, especially when attempting to predict the point spread.
